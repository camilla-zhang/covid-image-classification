# Covid Image Classification Project

This project was submitted to the **COVID Image Classification Hackathon** competition for my Advanced Projects in Machine Learning course. I use image data from Chowdhury et. al (2020) to detect when lungs X-rays show covid postivity, viral pneumonia, or healthy lungs. I then run at three hyper-tuned prediction models to try to predict the image classification - (1) VGG 16, (2) CNN, and (3) MLP. Finally, I discuss which models performed better and point out relevant hyper-parameter values for successful models.
